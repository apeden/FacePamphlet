# FacePamphlet
Completion of assignment 7 of the Stanford Univeristy Java course (2007/8) available as Open courseware


## Installation

This repository only contains source code at the moment. The code is run in conjunction with an acm jar, and also a folder of images used to adorn the facepamphlet profiles 

```
Not ready for installation just yet... run from Eclipse. 
```

## Usage

The programme creates a GUI (using the acm library etc) inside of which is you can add delete or lookup profiles. You can add photos to profiles, change status (kinda like a micro-blog) or add friends. Friendships are forced to be mutual.
